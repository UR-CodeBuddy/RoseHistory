							According to its vibrant history, roses grew in the Northern Hemisphere
							but was first cultivated in China about 5000 years ago. Even the Roman 
							culture is rich with stories about roses where they were used as 
							celebration confetti, garden flowers, and perfume for the elite.

							In the 1800s, Napoleon Bonaparte’s wife, Josephine, gathered the period’s
							prestigious botanists and horticulturists to build an extensive collection
							of roses, which is still considered as one of the greatest rose gardens that
							exist.
